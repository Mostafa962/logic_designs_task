Heloo dear,

I used database to hold file's names then read from database ,I can do task without using Database,
but I prefer to use database and Send Files using Ajax Request in Jquery.
============
Steps To Open project in localhost
1-Extact folder
2-create database called logic_design in your host
3-import logic_design.sql into your database
	and make sure that your connection to DB does not use password 
	if there is a password ,you can go to config.php and change DB_PASS to your password
4-make sure that your project in following path
	 C:\xampp\htdocs	               
5-in browser you can request
	http://localhost/logic_design_task/
then enjoy :)
===========
or you can check Task in online host here
	http://logicdesign200.000webhostapp.com
==========
note:
	if you use online host ,you must wait few secondes until file uploaded then appear in page 			without reloaded
